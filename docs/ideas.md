- [ ] Implement controllers for handling game actions and API requests
- [ ] Use Laravel's Blade templating or a frontend framework (Vue.js, React) for views

#### API Client Extension
- [ ] Extend the existing `CalabozosApiClient.php` with additional endpoints:
  ```php
  // In App\Services\Api\CalabozosApi.php
  public function getRaces(): array
  {
      $response = $this->get('/races');
      return $response->json();
  }

  public function getSpells(): array
  {
      $response = $this->get('/spells');
      return $response->json();
  }

  public function getMonsters(): array
  {
      $response = $this->get('/monsters');
      return $response->json();
  }
  ```
- [ ] Implement service classes for game logic (CharacterService, CombatService, etc.)
- [ ] Use Laravel's dependency injection for clean service integration

#### API Integration
- [ ] Use Laravel's Cache facade for API response caching:
  ```php
  public function getClasses(): array
  {
      return Cache::remember('dnd.classes', 3600, function () {
          $response = $this->get('/classes');
          return $response->json();
      });
  }
  ```
- [ ] Implement Laravel Jobs for handling long-running API requests
- [ ] Create fallback mechanisms using Laravel's retry functionality
- [ ] Develop a system for extending API data with custom content using Laravel's database

#### Database Design
- [ ] Use Laravel migrations to create and manage database schema:
  ```bash
  php artisan make:model Character -m
  php artisan make:model Monster -m
  php artisan make:model Spell -m
  ```
- [ ] Implement Eloquent relationships between different game elements
- [ ] Use Laravel's schema builder for efficient table design
